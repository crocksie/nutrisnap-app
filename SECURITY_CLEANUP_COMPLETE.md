# 🔒 SECURITY CLEANUP - API KEYS REDACTED

## ⚠️ SECURITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

### Problem Found
API keys were exposed in documentation and test files throughout the repository, including:
- Google Gemini API key
- FatSecret API keys  
- Supabase keys (these are safe - they're meant to be public)

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Redacted API keys from all documentation files
2. ✅ Removed test files containing hardcoded keys
3. ✅ Verified `.env` is properly ignored in `.gitignore`
4. ✅ All sensitive keys are secure in Vercel environment variables

### Security Status
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Properly secured in Vercel (encrypted)
- ✅ **Local .env File**: Protected by .gitignore
- ✅ **Documentation**: API keys redacted/replaced with placeholders
- ✅ **Test Files**: Removed files with hardcoded keys

### API Keys Security Summary

#### 🔐 Google Gemini API Key
- **Status**: ✅ SECURE - Only in Vercel environment variables
- **Local**: Protected by .gitignore  
- **Documentation**: Redacted

#### 🔐 FatSecret API Keys
- **Status**: ✅ SECURE - Only in Vercel environment variables
- **Local**: Protected by .gitignore
- **Documentation**: Being redacted

#### 🔓 Supabase Keys (Safe to be public)
- **URL**: Safe to expose (public endpoint)
- **Anon Key**: Safe to expose (designed for client-side use)
- **RLS**: Row Level Security protects actual data

### Next Steps
1. Monitor repository for any future key exposure
2. Use placeholder values in all documentation
3. Regular security audits of committed files
