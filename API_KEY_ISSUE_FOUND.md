# 🚨 API KEY SECURITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED

## Problem Found
The Google Gemini API key provided was **INVALID/DISABLED**.

When tested directly with curl, Google returns:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key.",
    "status": "INVALID_ARGUMENT"
  }
}
```

## Root Cause
The API key was previously exposed in the GitHub repository (as documented in SECURITY_INCIDENT.md) and was likely automatically disabled by Google's security scanning.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION NEEDED

### 🔑 Get New Google Gemini API Key
1. **Visit**: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. **Create new API key**
3. **Copy the new key**

### 🔧 Update Vercel Environment Variables
Once you have the new key, I'll help you:
1. Remove the old invalid key from Vercel
2. Add the new valid key
3. Redeploy the application

### 🧪 Test Results
- ✅ Environment variables are properly set in Vercel
- ✅ Application builds and deploys successfully  
- ❌ Google Gemini API key is invalid/disabled
- ✅ Other APIs (Supabase, FatSecret) are working

## Next Action Required
**Please generate a new Google Gemini API key and provide it so I can update the Vercel deployment.**
