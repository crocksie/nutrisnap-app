# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE

## What Happened
API keys were accidentally committed to the public GitHub repository, triggering GitHub's secret scanning alerts.

## Immediate Actions Taken
1. ‚úÖ Removed exposed API keys from all files
2. ‚úÖ Replaced with placeholder values
3. ‚è≥ Need to commit and push changes
4. ‚è≥ Need to rotate/regenerate API keys

## API Keys That Need Immediate Rotation

### 1. Google Gemini API Key
- **Exposed Key**: `[REDACTED - Key was rotated]`
- **Action**: Generate new key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### 2. Supabase Keys
- **Project URL**: `https://swgrbthpvxaxuwkhjuld.supabase.co`
- **Action**: Check Supabase dashboard for unauthorized access

### 3. FatSecret API Keys
- **API Key**: `[REDACTED - Keys were rotated]`
- **Shared Secret**: `[REDACTED - Keys were rotated]`
- **Action**: Regenerate at [FatSecret Platform](https://platform.fatsecret.com/)

## Next Steps
1. Commit sanitized code
2. Rotate all API keys
3. Update Vercel environment variables with new keys
4. Monitor for unauthorized usage
5. Close GitHub security alerts

## Prevention
- Never commit real API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Add .env files to .gitignore
- Use placeholder values in documentation
